# Runbook — Meta-story pipeline close-out (split-healer · overflow cap · deferred re-cluster)

Operator/dev close-out for the post-clustering meta-story work: the deterministic
**split-healer** ([`cluster-split-healer.mjs`](../apps/api/src/dashboard/cluster-split-healer.mjs)),
the **max-5 overflow cap**, the **deferred re-cluster** queue + executor
([`deferred-recluster.mjs`](../apps/api/src/dashboard/deferred-recluster.mjs)), and
the diagnostics that surface them. All of this is the deterministic layer that runs
**after** clustering inside [`refresh-pipeline.mjs`](../apps/api/src/dashboard/refresh-pipeline.mjs);
no new LLM step is added by any of it.

Sections map to the implementation slices: **A** = split/English/cap, **B** =
deferred re-cluster, **C** = diagnostics + tests.

## 1. Pre-flight checklist

### Happy path — one-command E2E prep (strict identity + reset + gates)

```bash
cd 05-engineering
npm run e2e:prepare-user -- --user-id <userId> --email <email>
```

This is the primary path for a clean E2E run. It starts the API watcher and web
dev server in the background, then runs `dev:api:clean` (with
`TEMPO_E2E_FORCE_FIRST_FULL_REFRESH=true` and `TEMPO_E2E_STRICT_IDENTITY=true`),
`e2e:reset-user`, `e2e:assert-clean`, and `e2e:preflight` (`--require-web`,
`--require-strict-identity`, `--require-web-identity-override`,
`--identity-email <email>`). If any gate fails, stop and fix before testing.

After this passes, jump to §2 — the steps below are only needed as a fallback.

### Manual fallback

Use the numbered steps below only if the one-command prep is unavailable or you
need to run a single step in isolation; they are the manual equivalents of what
`e2e:prepare-user` automates.

1. **Start both servers** from `05-engineering/`:
   ```bash
   npm run dev          # build:packages, then concurrently dev:api + dev:web
   # or run the halves separately:
   #   npm run dev:api   # node --watch apps/api/src/main.mjs  (port 8787)
   #   npm run dev:web   # vite dev server in ../04-prototype
   ```
2. **Confirm the API is reachable** (default `TEMPO_API_PORT=8787`, see
   [`main.mjs`](../apps/api/src/main.mjs)):
   ```bash
   curl -s localhost:8787/health        # GET /health → ok
   ```
3. **Reset the test user's state**.
   - **File-based dev path** (default data dir `./data`, override
     `TEMPO_DATA_DIR`). Replace `<userId>` with the run's user id (e.g. the
     `e06…` UX-test user):
   ```bash
   cd 05-engineering/apps/api
   rm -f data/dashboard_snapshot_<userId>.json \
         data/meta_story_locks_<userId>.json \
         data/geo_hold_bucket_<userId>.json \
         data/settings_user_<userId>.json
   ```
   (Narratives are Supabase-only — no file to delete on the local path.)
   - **Supabase-backed path** (`SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
     enabled): clear this user's rows from:
     - `settings` (`key = user:<userId>`, set `data` to `[]` for a fresh start)
     - `dashboard_snapshots`
     - `meta_story_locks`
     - `story_rejections`
     - `geo_hold_bucket`
     - `user_onboarding_narratives`
     Use your existing reset script/SQL for this repository's E2E flow.
4. **Clear prototype browser storage** (DevTools console on the app origin) so the
   client starts as a clean first-time identity / heartbeat:
   ```js
   localStorage.removeItem("tempo_proto_session");   // recognized identity
   localStorage.removeItem("tempo_did");             // analytics device id
   sessionStorage.removeItem("tempo_sid");           // analytics session id
   Object.keys(localStorage)
     .filter((k) => k.startsWith("tempo.settings.v1"))
     .forEach((k) => localStorage.removeItem(k));     // settings cache (global + per-user)
   ```
   For E2E identity routing, run the web app with:
   `VITE_E2E_IDENTITY_PRECEDENCE=recognized_email`.
5. **Local English E2E** — for a landing → dashboard run that turns the Spanish
   feeds into **English** stories, the translation stage must be live (it is a
   fail-open no-op otherwise — see [`.env.example`](../apps/api/.env.example)
   "Local E2E: Spanish feeds → English stories" and the
   [translation runbook](runbook-translation-activation.md)):
   - Activation is mode-driven: `TEMPO_TRANSLATION_MODE=auto` (the default)
     auto-activates the stage for Spanish feeds. Use `on` to force it; the
     legacy `TEMPO_TRANSLATION_ENABLED` still overrides if set.
   - `TEMPO_OPENAI_API_KEY=<key>` set **and** `TEMPO_AI_MOCK_ONLY` unset (a real
     `translateFn` is wired only on a non-mock box with a key).
   - **Restart the API after changing env** — these are read at process start,
     not per-request (`npm run dev:api`, or restart `npm run dev`).
   - **Verify in the API logs** on the next refresh:
     - `[pipeline.translation] mode=auto … enabled=true …` (the stage is on), and
     - when the candidate pool has Spanish items: `needed>0` **and** `translated>0`.
   - Mock-only / no-key → translation is a no-op; ES stories stay Spanish. This is
     **expected — not a clustering or split-healer regression** (the items simply
     passed through untranslated).

> **Known current limitation — Spanish election lexical recall.** Recall for
> Spanish election terms still depends on the translation stage being live: with
> translation off / mock-only / no key, Spanish-only election items can be missed
> because the keyword filter matches on normalized English evidence. Direct
> Spanish-lexeme recall (matching e.g. `elecciones` without translation) is not
> yet implemented — track expectations accordingly when reviewing an ES run.

## 2. Section A — expected outcomes (split / English / cap)

- **Dashboard ships 1–5 stories.** The post-healer **overflow cap** trims any
  excess deterministically (Q6-C survival rank: multi-source → beat-fit → freshness
  → `metaStoryId`). Upstream `0` stories (fail-closed clustering) stays `0` — the
  cap never fabricates.
- **Split-healer output is English when normalized evidence exists.** Split/bundled
  stories read `readHeadline` / `readBody`, so a translated ES cluster yields English
  `title` / `subtitle` / `summary`. With no normalization present, output falls back
  to the original text (safe).
- **Split triggers are tightened:** `disjoint_claim_evidence` splits high-confidence;
  `low_token_overlap` only acts on **normalized English** evidence; ambiguous
  non-English over-merges are **deferred (flagged), not atomized**.
- **Overflow cap diagnostics are available** on `_meta.overflowCap` whenever the cap
  ran (see §4).

## 3. Section B — expected outcomes (deferred re-cluster)

- **`reclusterQueue` appears when ambiguous candidates exist.** B1 scores the A3
  `_reclusterCandidate` flags and emits a ranked, deduped queue (top **2**) on
  `_meta.reclusterQueue` / `reclusterQueueCount`.
- **The deferred executor runs bounded:** after the fast snapshot write,
  fire-and-forget, **≤2 candidates, sequentially, 45s timeout each**. It re-clusters
  only each candidate's source set and grounds the result with the existing pipeline
  grounding.
- **Patching is in place:** a successful + grounded re-cluster replaces only the
  affected story slot(s); the result is still bounded by the max-5 cap. On
  **failure / timeout / invalid / stale generation** the Phase-1 snapshot is left
  unchanged (no dashboard blanking). Outcomes land on `_meta.reclusterExecution`
  on the **next** dashboard read (it runs after the immediate refresh response).

## 4. Debug checks (`?debug=1`)

Open the dashboard with `?debug=1` (or set `VITE_UX_TEST_MODE=true`); the
[`DashboardRunDiagnostics`](../../04-prototype/src/components/DashboardRunDiagnostics.tsx)
panel renders (gating: `debugMode = isUxTestMode || searchParams.get("debug") === "1"`).
Inspect these three rows (parsed from the API `_meta`):

| Row (`data-testid`) | Reads | Healthy | Needs attention |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`split/defer:`** (`diag-cluster-split`) | `_meta.clusterSplit` — `in/out`, `splits=(reasons)`, `bundled`, `deferred=(deferReasons)`, `candidates=[ids]` | a few or zero splits; occasional `deferred` with candidate ids listed | every refresh atomizing many splits, or large `deferred` with no follow-up re-cluster resolution |
| **`overflow_cap:`** (`diag-overflow-cap`) | `_meta.overflowCap` | `not_applied (in=N out=N)` with `N≤5` is the normal path | `applied … dropped=K [ids]` **frequently** ⇒ clustering over-producing upstream; confirm the dropped ids are the lowest-ranked |
| **`recluster:`** (`diag-recluster`) | `_meta.reclusterExecution` (falls back to the B1 queued count) | `n/a` (no queue), `pending queued=N` right after a refresh, or `status=completed` on the next read | `status=failed` / `partial_failure` repeatedly, or `pending queued=N` that never resolves to a status (executor not running) |

`status` enum: `noop` · `completed` · `partial_failure` · `failed`.
Per-candidate `outcome` enum: `confirmed` · `split` · `timeout` · `error` · `empty` · `ungrounded` · `not_found`.

The same blocks are available without the UI via the API:
```bash
curl -s localhost:8787/api/dashboard -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  | jq '._meta | {clusterSplit, overflowCap, reclusterQueueCount, reclusterExecution}'
```

## 5. Rollback / safety levers (already in code — no deploy needed)

| Lever | Env knob | Default | Effect when toggled |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Split-healer off** | `TEMPO_CLUSTER_SPLIT_HEALER_ENABLED=false` | `true` | Over-merges are NOT split — a multi-topic cluster ships as one story; no defer flags, so the re-cluster queue stays empty. Instant rollback for any split/defer regression. |
| **Split sensitivity** | `TEMPO_CLUSTER_SPLIT_JACCARD_THRESHOLD` | `0.15` | Higher → splits less (more tolerant of overlap); lower → splits more aggressively. Tune before disabling outright. |
| **Translation mode** | `TEMPO_TRANSLATION_MODE=auto\|on\|off` | `auto` (legacy `TEMPO_TRANSLATION_ENABLED` overrides) | `off` disables ES normalization and can narrow recall for English keywords; `auto` activates only when non-English evidence is present; `on` forces translation attempts always. See the [translation runbook](runbook-translation-activation.md). |
| **Force mocks** | `TEMPO_AI_MOCK_ONLY=true` | unset | All live LLM calls (incl. the production `translateFn`) become deterministic mocks/no-ops; the deferred re-cluster uses the mock cluster path. Use for local/CI determinism. |

The deferred re-cluster executor has **no kill-switch of its own** — it only acts when
`reclusterQueue` is non-empty, and disabling the split-healer (above) empties that
queue, which is the de-facto off switch for Section B.

## One clean E2E pass (Spanish reset scenario)

1. Reset user `<userId>` files + browser storage (§1.3–§1.4).
2. Ensure Spanish E2E env is live (§1.5): `TEMPO_TRANSLATION_MODE=auto`,
   `TEMPO_OPENAI_API_KEY` set, `TEMPO_AI_MOCK_ONLY` unset. Start `npm run dev`.
3. Onboard the user with a bilateral (ES/EN) beat, land on the dashboard, then open
   it with `?debug=1`.
4. Expect: **1–5** stories, English titles/subtitles even for Spanish sources, and:
   - `split/defer:` shows any over-merges split into English stories (or `deferred`
     for ambiguous ES with `candidates=[…]`),
   - `overflow_cap:` `not_applied` for ≤5 (or `applied … dropped=[…]` if clustering
     produced >5),
   - `recluster:` `pending queued=N` immediately, resolving to `status=completed`
     (or `noop`) on the next refresh/read.
5. If anything looks wrong, pull `_meta` via the `curl | jq` line in §4 and use the
   §5 levers to roll back the suspect stage.

### E2E success checklist (English run)

A landing → onboarding → dashboard pass is **green** when all of the following hold
(after the reset in §1.3–§1.4 and the env in §1.5):

- [ ] **1–5 stories visible** on the dashboard (never 0 for a populated beat; never >5).
- [ ] **Story titles and subtitles are in English**, even when the underlying
      sources are Spanish.
- [ ] API logs show `[pipeline.translation] mode=auto … enabled=true` and, when ES
      items were in the pool, `needed>0 translated>0` (per §1.5).
- [ ] **No** `[dashboard.get] … failed schema validation … returning empty` line in
      the API logs (that line means the snapshot fail-closed on read — investigate the
      persisted payload, e.g. an invalid `sources[].kind`).

If stories render but titles are **Spanish**, re-check §1.5: translation is almost
certainly off / mock-only / missing a key — that is expected behavior, not a
clustering or split-healer regression.
